msgid "message_frequent_questions"
msgstr "1. What is a VPN?\n\n"
"This is a service that allows you to connect to another geographic location, create a channel between you and the server, and route all your internet traffic through that server. This is useful for bypassing censorship, accessing restricted services in your country, and keeping your traffic private.\n\n"
"2. Why {shop_name}?\n\n"
"{shop_name} offers numerous advantages:\n\n" 
"• 5-day free trial\n" 
"• easy setup\n" 
"• fast, secure, private, and anonymous\n" 
"• unlimited traffic\n" 
"• personal access delivered via Telegram for enhanced privacy\n" 
"• dedicated customer support\n\n"
"3. Why shouldn't you use free VPNs?\n\n"
"Free VPN providers need to make money somehow, so they often track and sell user data, show intrusive ads, and utilize the computing power of your devices.\n\n"
"4. Can you view my traffic?\n\n"
"No, we cannot. The technologies we use conceal and encrypt all your traffic as it travels between you and our servers. We don’t care which websites you visit; our goal is to ensure unrestricted access to internet services.\n\n"
"5. How many devices can I connect?\n\n"
"There are no limits on the number of devices; the only restriction applies to traffic."
